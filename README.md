# NpcAbilities

## Description/features
For each ability an NPC has, this addon adds a line to the game's NPC tooltip. Additionally, it is possible to press a hotkey (configurable) to display more information about the ability.
This includes optional lines for the ability mechanic, range, cast time and dispel type.
Furthermore, you can choose the language in which this information is displayed. Currently, all languages that Blizzard offers are also supported by the addon.
Information in the addon will be updated at least biweekly to ensure that the data is as accurate as possible. 
However, as this addon depends on information provided by a third party, there is a possibility of data inaccuracies.
